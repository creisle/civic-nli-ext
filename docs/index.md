The CIViC natural language interpretation (NLI) project aims to collect a fact-checking companion data set for [CIViC](https://civicdb.org/). This dataset will collect spans or sentences from full-text scientific articles which have been used to enter CIViC evidence items. The particular sentences/spans in the text which should be selected are those that are sufficient and required to ensure the article does indeed contain/support the CIViC entry.

## Getting Started

This project uses chrome extensions to help annotators collect data through a web service called hyopthes.is, therefore you will need the following

- access to google chrome
- sign up for a [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is) account
- install the [hypothes.is chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek?hl=en)
- install the CIViC-NLI chrome extension: https://github.com/creisle/civic-nli-ext

Once you have all the following set up, message the project lead to get the hypothes.is annotation group URL to join the private annotation group.

If you are already a CIViC curator, the simplest way to get started is to annotate the last paper you entered into CIViC.
