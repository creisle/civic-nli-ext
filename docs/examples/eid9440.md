Above we can see that we are looking for supporting text which states that TP53:p.C135F is a loss-of-function variant. In this article there is only 1 place where the C135F variant is mentioned, table 1. This table also happens to have the functional characterization for the variant so selecting the row in this table should be sufficient support for someone reviewing the entry (since the header includes the gene name)
